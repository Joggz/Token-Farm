# Token-Farm-DeFi-

Defi app built with Solidity, truffle react box, javascript, Ganache(for test development). Ropsten (test net).


### Will rewrite this project using hardhat
Reason - Networks  not updating in abi with the testnet network after migrating contract to Ropsten.
seems to be a truffle sort of issue.
